# Sdr-Hardware-Control
This project includes an Arduino sketch and circuit diagram to control popular SDR windows program SDR#.
If you ever wanted to control your software defined radio with physical controls like the classical hardware radios this project tries to show you how to do it. 

## Getting Started

TBA

### Prerequisites
-You need to install SDRSharp and configure it according to your needs. https://airspy.com/download/
-You need to install SDRSharp Net Remote Control plugin from the download page http://eartoearoak.com/software/sdrsharp-net-remote
